THIS DIRECTORY IS DEPRECATED, AND IS NO LONGER USED IN THE PROJECT. THIS IS ONLY FOR ARCHIVING PURPOSES.

NOTE: This section of the project is meant to be run after setting up the relevant
python dependencies and NVIDIA GPU computing toolkit + CUDNN. Also, do download the
EMNIST dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/emnist and unzip the
contents into a new folder here called EMNIST_dataset.

Regardless, though, I would not recommend attempting to set up and run this on your 
own. Just pull the trained model.h5 file from the models folder to use if needed.
